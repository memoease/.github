## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to our Flashcard Application GitHub repository! This project is a collaborative effort to create a web-based flashcard application using JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, and MongoDB. Users can register, create their own flashcard sets, and optionally share them publicly on the website to collaborate with others.
